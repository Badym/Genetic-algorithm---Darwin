# Genetic-algorithm---Darwin
The "Genetic algorithm - Darwin" project uses a genetic algorithm to study how a population evolves over generations, focusing on key parameters like survival and reproduction rates. Implemented in C++, this simulator allows users to input specific parameters and observe population dynamics.


Key Features:
	
Extinction rate (-w):         The individual with the lower rate dies in the next generation.
	
Reproduction rate (-r):       The individual with the higher rate will be able to be selected as a parent.
	
Number of Generations (-p):   Total generations to simulate.
	
Crossovers (-k):              New individuals created from randomly selected parents per generation.
	
Input File (-i):              Text file where each row represents an entity from the initial generation.
	
Output File (-o):             Text file where results are saved, with each row representing an entity from each generation.
